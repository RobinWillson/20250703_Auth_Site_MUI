# Building History
This site is build by AI. Generally DeepSeek is good enough. Gemini is better and free.

1. Before we start ask for AI, be sure add [AI_Guild](./AI%20Prompt/Gemini_guild.md) for first prompt.
2. Manually finish your project plan as [Project_Plan_LV1](./AI%20Prompt/Project_Plan_LV1.md)
3. Ask AI with level-1 plan, then you will get [Project_Plan_LV2](./AI%20Prompt/Project_Plan_LV2.md)
4. Ask AI with level-2 plan, then you can start building.
